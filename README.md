# SQL — Personal Query Collection

This repository is a personal collection of SQL queries I'm writing and experimenting with while learning. It's a simple place to save examples, notes, and small queries I want to keep or revisit.

## Purpose
- Save and organize SQL snippets and exercises.
- Track learning progress and common patterns.
- Provide quick examples to copy/paste when practicing.

## How I use this repo
- Add one query per file or group related queries in a single file.
- Name files to reflect the topic, e.g. `joins_sql`, `date_aggregations.sql`.
- Keep short comments inside each SQL file to explain intent or gotchas.
